Oh my... what did I watch! 

I somewhat felt bad while watching this movie. It was unoriginal, not funny, forced, and made no sense. The CGI was also bad at most parts. 
The movie was cringy at many times. The actresses and actors are clearly talented and having a women only Ghostbusters movie could have worked! But no. The story was stupid, the characters were stereotypes, male characters were unbelievably dumb. It had jokes all the time and they didn't really work! Some CGI work was pretty good, but mostly they're neon ghosts and the green screen was so obvious at some parts. 
Most cameos were totally unnecessary. The villain wasn't menacing at all and his motivations were just lame. And how he got that power? Well... no explanations. The movie has lots of logical flaws. 
There were good parts of it but not enough. In overall it's a bad movie. It's not one of those bad movies that are so bad it's good an it makes you laugh on how horrible it is. It's just an insult to the beloved franchise! Sadly it failed to deliver. It clearly had potential but it didn't live up to it.
