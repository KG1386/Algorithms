This movie is a failure, a shameless cashgrab, riding on the fame of a beloved franchise. Unfunny, clichè, over the top, filled with juvenile and lazy jokes, stereotypes... the amount of effort put into this is minimal. I dont even feel like to sumarize all of the problems this thing has, for it has taken enough of my time already. Let it be know its totally OK to dislike this movie, for it is bad, and you shouldn't feel guiilty about it. The whole "you dont like it becaouse you're sexist" is the perfect alibi.
