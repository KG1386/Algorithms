An awful mess. Don't see it, don't give them your money. Should've just been a SNL Skit. 

Talented actresses, but everything falls flat. Everything is wiped clean from the real Ghostbusters. 

Replaced good writing & comedy with mile-a-minute jokes that don't land. 

Constantly hating on men and shows men in a negative light. Men characters act absolutely dumb. Absolute garbage. 

The original worked because of the great writing. The writing is just not present here. 

Only memorable moment is the "from the front" fart joke. And that's because it's so bad.
