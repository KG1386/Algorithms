I would rate this an 8/10....but I will give it a 10 to balance the zeros. 

Is it funny yes! 
Is it good yes! 
Is it entertaining! 

Wiig, McCarthy(?), and Thor are hilarious. 

And just a side note....I went back and watched the 1984 Ghostbusters....nostalgia....I think in general we should erase the 1980s from human history. Forget it ever happened....it was an awful time full of bad movies and embarrassing photos....... 

Except for Guns N Roses......let's just pretend they started in the 90s.
