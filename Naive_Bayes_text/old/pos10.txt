I loved this movie. The women in it are great together and all bring their own style of comedy that blends well with their cast members. I laughed throughout this film! Who doesn't love a movie that has amazingly smart women who turn-up as the sheros! 

Beyond the great comedic acting, the film makers sprinkled a lot from the previous movie in which was fantastic. There are cameos, there is the famed marshmallow man, basically same events happening. In a brilliant way, they still made the movie have it's own story-line while at the same time bringing back all the old stuff we love about the 1984 classic. 

Very well done. I would pay theater money to see it again! Hopefully this cast continues making films together.
