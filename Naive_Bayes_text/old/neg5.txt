Whereas the original's first 45 minutes are some of the funniest moments ever in cinema, the first hour of this slog was entirely NOT funny at all, unless you're a teenie bopper girl who actually believes Kristen Wiig is a decent actress and that Melissa McCarthy is funny. 

McKinnon and Jones are the best of the bunch, and they're typically in the background. This film used the cameos and the homages to the original to make it watchable, but it cannot stand on its own. 

Hemsworth was downright annoying! 

Thank goodness I was taken to this film as a treat, and I didn't have to spend a single penny on it. It's best to grab it as a rental, or skip it altogether.
