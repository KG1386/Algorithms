This was pretty bad. I was really bored overall and really had nothing of the magic of the original. Cameo appearances were nice but would have been better if they were the original characters. My wife and daughter enjoyed it a lot. It seems to be favorable among some women so I recommend it for a date night. The writing is really really weak.
