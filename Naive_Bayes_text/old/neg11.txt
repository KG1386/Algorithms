Ghostbusters 2016 doesn't understand what made the original special, and even fails to be entertaining on its own merits by constantly trying to emulate the original while failing. Wiig's and McCarthy's characters come across as bland compared to their usual roles. McKinnon's is annoyingly weird. Jones' character is a straight up loud racial stereotype. The only character that works most of the time is Hemsworth's, but it's not enough to save this movie. The plot weak and uninteresting, something that seemed to have been haphazardly thrown together for the movie rather than something crafted with care, so much so in fact that the movie's own self contained logic gets thrown to the wind at points. The original Ghostbusters made the implausible seem plausible, and took an absurd premise while playing it straight. Ghostbusters 2016 takes cartoonish characters and inserts them into a poorly written plot with lowest common denominator penis-vagina-fart-piss joke humor I'd be ashamed to show to my kid. 

Verdict: This movie is neither worth a watch at the theaters or even an eventual rent. If you need Ghostbusters, stick to the original.
