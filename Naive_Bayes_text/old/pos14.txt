Ironically neither as good or as bad as anyone wanted it to be, Paul Feig's "Ghostbusters" reboot brings the laughs, scares, and imaginative effects, but to nowhere as high of a degree as its 1984 predecessor did. High marks go to Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones for giving it their all in almost every scene, but it's the surprisingly well-conceived narrative that just saves this picture from the middling plains of mediocrity. It could have been much better and it could very well have been much worse, but - in the end - the simple fact about "Ghostbusters" still remains: the film just kind of "exists" and doesn't do much more than that.
