So much frickin hilarious. Feel sorry for all the grumpers who're getting mad about a movie that is pure fun with brilliant female comedians. I had a smile on my face the whole time. Watched the original Ghostbusters last night after watching this one the night before... Maybe those that are calling it there favorite movie of all time should go back and watch it... it's pretty great, but a lot less funny than I remember it.
