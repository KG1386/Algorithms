Listen, I am not gonna lie about how old I am, I am 14 years old and I have already the original ghostbusters movie and its sequel; I know that this movie punched in the face to the fans of the original ghostbusters movie, but this movie wasn't made for those who love the original. This movie was made for the new generations like me. The movie was lots of fun and I hope this movie might be able to find its public.
