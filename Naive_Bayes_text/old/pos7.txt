I would give this an 8 but to many people are under rating this just because they feel entitled to this franchise. 
The reviews for this are like the river of hate filled slime from ghostbusters 2 
I personally love the original movies and the cartoon series and this is a fine installment to the franchise. 
I hope they can find enough encouragement to make a sequel.
