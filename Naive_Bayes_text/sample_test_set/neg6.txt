What a huge disappointment. I went into this with an open mind and left frustrated and annoyed. There were a few moments that made me chuckle, and I absolutely loved the intro scene, to the point that I turned to my gf and said "if the rest is like that I will be soooo happy, that was awesome!". Unfortunately it was not. The plot was absolutely terrible, the forced cameos were completely unnecessary and the ending was horrendous. 

The actresses were a bit of a split bag, Melissa Mcarthy and Leslie Jones were actually the funniest out of the bunch, which I was not expecting. The trailers showed Leslie Jones character to be a stereotypical sassy black woman, when instead she played very similar to the originals Winston Zeddemore. Kristen Wigg was ok, however Kate McKinnon's "wacky" character grated from the very start, feeling very forced and irritating. 

I really am still scratching my head over a lot of the plot trying to understand it. 

Overall this was a below average, poorly written movie that actually showed some potential but couldn't get past the awful plot.
