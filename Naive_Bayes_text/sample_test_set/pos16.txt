This movie is fantastic! First off, the cast did a great job with their roles. I can't say that one person stood out. Next I want to give props to the director. The movie looks great including the effects. The colors are really vibrant! The movie isn't full of funny jokes, but it is wildly entertaining, and I really enjoyed it. Totally recommended for the whole family!
