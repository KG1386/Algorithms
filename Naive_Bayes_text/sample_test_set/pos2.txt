2.7? That's what I thought I was going to give it too. 

But then I actually went and saw it. It was great! It's a funny, likable movie. Honored the original while doing something new. 

Wiig and McCarthy are wonderful. Helmsworth was a bit annoying but contributed some good laughs. Lots of good subtle humor along with big laughs.
