I think it's a good sign that I started laughing pretty much immediately, and I basically didn't stop until the first act of the movie ended. The scriptwriting and casting were both fantastic, and all four leading ladies did an excellent job. The movie separates itself from the original with strong, unique characters and a new plot but stays recognizable. My only complaint is that the second act of the movie, setting up the villain for the final conflict, seemed to drag on for a bit, but it was short enough before the action got started and everything was back to being a joy to watch.
