If I remove my emotions around the original movie, this reboot is a strong 7. I was against the idea of a reboot and went to see it, because I loved the original and Dan Aykroyd had good things to say about it. We saw it in a packed theatre on Union Square in NYC. There were tons of people laughing at the appropriate times. I didn't find it laugh out loud funny, but it was amusing, like a comic strip. Typical that all the 'good' scenes are from the trailer. Plot was decent, but moved too slowly. Nothing subtle about the switch of female leads with a hot, dumb male which was obvious and in your face. Kate McKinnon is the best part and sadly, her gun licking is her best scene. All the original cast's cameos are brief and shoe-horned in and added nothing special. Based on the audience's reaction, I must say that it felt like a solid 70-75, but my emotions got in the way and I just felt sad and a little foolish that a silly movie from my childhood could evoke such a strong reaction. They chose to do a reboot and not the passing of the torch. I think teens who don't know or care about the original will love this movie and all us 'old people' just have to accept that our pop culture is gone. I've become that old guy who said, "Who's this Indiana Jones? Back in my day, Errol Flynn, now there's a hero!". Go see it, but do yourself a favor and don't compare it to the original. You might like it. If I rate this movie through the lens of the original, it's more like a 3, but I'm just some middle-aged guy who still loves the movies he grew up with...
