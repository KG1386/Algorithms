The story is pretty bland and generic, As is the action. There is far too much CGI and it looks no where near as good as the first film. Honestly, The only reason anyone would want to see this is if they were a die hard fan of the leads. Other than that, No one should bother with it. It doesn't live up to the first film at all, If anything it's a massive down grade.
