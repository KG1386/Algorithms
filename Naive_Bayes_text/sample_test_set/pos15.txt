Fleeting. I mean, this movie just whizzes by. 

The performances are great, and there's something to be said about Kate Mckinnon here. 

But this is about as disjointed as a Supernatural-Comedy can get. The genre's don't work together, they're just there. 

Pales to the original, but that IS a pretty high bar.
