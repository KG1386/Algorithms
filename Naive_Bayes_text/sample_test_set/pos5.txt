I think it's great that all these people who were so staunchly against this movie are shelling out money to see it, given the amount of reviews it has! Shame no one here seemed to enjoy it as much as we did; our screening was packed and shared several applause breaks! 

Long and short of it is if you like Paul Feig's other films, you'll like this one. Similar character-driven humor. If you don't, this movie's not for you. Ladies had great chemistry, the cameos were a delight and I look forward to seeing it again.
