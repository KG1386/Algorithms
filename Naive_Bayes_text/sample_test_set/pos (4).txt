OK Im a guy giving a movie review about Ghostbuster and I dont care about all the back & forth between the haters that never went to the movie vs women that said its was great no matter what. I HAD FUN. laughed a ton and yeah jokes against men? they were funny. it felt to me like they totally paid respect to the classic version - the sure as heck didnt turn their back on it. also think Kristen Wiig gets no respect. she's funny but can play it straight-up normal. i recommend.
