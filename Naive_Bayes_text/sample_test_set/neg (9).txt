Ice Age: Collision Course was a huge failure. Characters were all uninteresting (Even Scrat lost his humor in this), Story was OKAY, the "villains" are SUPER forgettable, Most jokes are unfunny or just plain bad, it's even worse than Ice Age: Continental Drift. Don't even bother to watch this movie, it was a disaster. 

The only good thing was the animation. Nothing else.
