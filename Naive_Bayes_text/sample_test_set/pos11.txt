The Ghostbusters reboot pays respect to the cast and story of the original (including a nice little blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to Harrold Ramis) while effortlessly managing to be its own thing as well. Kate McKinnon was the standout of the the leading ladies making me laugh almost every time the camera was on her, but all four actresses were great. Chris Hemsworth was also fantastic, and left me wondering why he doesn't do more comedy roles. Although it's different and not as amazing as the original (which is one of the best movies ever made), this is still a damn good movie. No movie is perfect, but The Ghostbusters reboot is one of the better ones I've seen this year.
