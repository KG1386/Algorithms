I really enjoyed this movie!! The 3D wasn't worth the price but aside from that this movie was refreshing. Yes the original will always be better because it's a classic, but the way that the classic characters had minor cameos while allowing the new characters to develop and really lead the show. I have heard that people felt that the special effects went too far but considering that this is suppose to be a sci-fi comedy I thought it was perfect. I really hope they continue on this trend of good re-releases (Star Trek, Star Wars) and give this movie a sequel using the criticism of users to improve the franchise.
