Can we PLEASE kill off this franchise already? 
Ice Age: Collision Course is the 5th movie in the Ice Age series; why this series has 5 movies, we'll never know. Now i'll admit, the first 2 Ice Age films were actually pretty good. They had likable characters, an interesting story, top-notch animation, etc. Ice Age 3 was where I started to question whether or not the series was going anywhere, and Ice Age 4 was complete crap. So where do you go after complete crap? Complete garbage. This is easily one of the worst films of the year so far. The characters that the movie try to introduce are uninteresting, the plot is nothing but a re-telling of the 4th movie, and there was hardly anything that made me laugh, minus one or two scenes with Scrat. Ice Age 5 also tries to throw in many subplots, and give you little reason to care about them. The charm and magic that made the first 2 good is nowhere to be found; it's as if the creators never watched the first two films. Granted, the animation was decent, and kids may find some enjoyment out of it, but that's about it. Ice Age 5 is nothing but a bland, uninteresting, and boring sequel that does nothing to add to the franchise. Again, kids may get some enjoyment out of it, but otherwise, don't waste your money on this unneeded waste of time. Go see Star Trek Beyond, it's so much better.
