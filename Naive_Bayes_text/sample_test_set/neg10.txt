The cold science was gone and replaced. The Ghostbusters theme sucked. Male character who mans the phone had no "cool" and no "brains". The ghosts were mostly neutered throughout the entire movie and posed no real threat. I'm severely disappointed. the only thing going was better terminology and effects, but no real application to the original style. The D6 game would have made a much better baseline for the movie.
