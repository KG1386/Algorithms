Implementation of k-nearest neighbour classification without libraries. 
KNN algorithm is a simple approach to classification that works by finding the distance from the test point to its neighbours within set boundary(k).

Very effective for small datasets due to its speed and the fact that its "lazy", which means that it creates entire model only at the moment when the prediction is required. This helps to avoid any biases over the data
and obtain localised model.
